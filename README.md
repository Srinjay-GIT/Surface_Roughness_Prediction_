# Surface_Roughness_Prediction_
This ANN model predicts the mean surface roughness parameter after turning a AISI H13 steel using 3 different tool conditions and 2 different depths of cut &amp; varying feed and cutting force keeping constant cutting speed. Scaling was performed. Early stopping was executed. Optimizer -adam, loss function-mse. R2 score-0.853 and MAPE-0.09%
